R code and data from Hurley, Hebblewhite and Gaillard. 2020. Competition for Safe Real Estate, Not Food, Drives Density-Dependent Juvenile Survival in a Large Herbivore. In Press, Ecology and Evolution.

A summary of the main data in the paper is provided; by each of the 5 years of the study in each of the two GMU treatment units, mule deer abundance (count) and density (density), naive K-M estimated mortality rate, mortality rate estimted from the Cox model with 95% confidence intervals, as well as the cause-specific mortality of Coyotes and Mountain Lions estimated by the CIF.txt files and associated SE's. 

Data for 6-month mule deer fawn survival is summarized in the file fawnsall.csv. 
Data for adult mule deer mother fawning elevation is summarized in AdultFawningElev.csv.
Data for the coyote predation risk used-available RSF model as a function of covariates are provided in  coyote_veg_1000_RSF.csv.

R code to estimate the Cause Specific Mortality rates are provided in CIF.txt (for all mortality) and for a specific-cause (e.g., Mountain Lion) in LionCIF.txt.
